Learning how to use GitHub
Hello, my name is Cole and I am a student at Auburn University. I am creating this as an experiment to learn how to use GitHub and to use for future school assignments and projects. My major is software engineering and my favorite language to use is Java. I have some experience in using Java, HTML, javascript, C++, and several other languages but am working towards my Bachelor's degree.
